# Openvino AI plugins for GIMP
Recently this repository https://github.com/intel/openvino-ai-plugins-gimp posted awesome GIMP plugins that leverage 
power of AI to bring graphic editing experience to another level.

Frankly I found installation process a bit complicated, so I wrote installer that installs everything for me.
Only thing is needed after you run this script is to add `<git clone folder>\gimpopenvino\plugins` your GIMP 
plugins folder `[Edit-> Preferences-> Folders-> Plugins]`.

/!\ Important note. Plugin pack (now Apr. 2023) appears to be working only with Gimp 2.99.10-2 development version.
